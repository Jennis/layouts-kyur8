Integration of Layouts with KYUR8:

Create segue from touches ended in LayoutEditor.m to a screen to select a photo and then send it back to layoutEditor and set loadedImage in the method equal to that UIImage.

Add desired backgrounds and overlay desired pictures on sliders, slider pointers, buttons, and change the navigation controller as well as the default picture loaded into each view.

Filters and a user interface for filters in preview.m (obviously not immediate)

Link a publish button on the preview.m page to the rest of the app and send the zine with it.  The zine is currently a mutable array of UIImages names “zine”

Link the app to the LayoutViewController to begin zine creation. 

Copy over the storyboard elements and recreate the links and segues if necessary.
